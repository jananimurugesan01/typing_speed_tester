The Typing Speed Tester GUI project aims to create a user-friendly application that
measures typing speed. This project implements a graphical user interface (GUI) to
enhance the user experience. Users will be prompted to type a randomly generated
string of words, and the application will measure and display their typing speed and
accuracy.
